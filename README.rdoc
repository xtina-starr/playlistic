This is a side project I developed to gain more experience working with APIs.

It uses the The Echo Nest API and a spotify player. Version 1 allows users to enter an artist name and returns a playlist of artists similar to that artist. 

You can checkout the application [here](http://playlistic.herokuapp.com/).
